# Electronic-Invoice-Processing
Use of Image Processing models such as **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to digitalize the process of invoice transactions. Moving towards fully automated invoice processing and extracting data from pdf/jpeg/webcam image into scalable xlsx/csv template. UI deployment using styling scripts.

## Python Libraries Used
* Pytesseract
* pdf2image
* OpenCV
* xlsxwriter
* NumPy
* Pandas

## What the model does?
* I/O: Loading data in the form of PDF/jpeg/webcam image 
* Performing feature extraction using OpenCV's existing algorithms
* Mapping the extracted features into scalable excel templates which are easy to process automatically

#### Deployment
The project is a part of ongoing **Flipkart Grid 2.0** competition in Software Delevelopment Module
